# kmeans riemannian segmentation dt mri
 The objective of this project is to develop methodologies for filtering DT-MRI images and segmenting these images through the use of a new approach that consists of using the Riemannian metric as a target object in the construction of new clustering and filtering algorithms using mass centers produced in a Riemannian context, more precisely, in a non-Euclidean viewpoint.
